I used simple HTML5 semantic codes and css3 to create the first few contents of BBC.co.uk (content not necessarily updated). 

This is the html/css project of Rob Percival's Complete Web Development course on Udemy. The instruction called for using xhtml and css2 but after I did that I converted the code to html5 and css3 after I also learned the latter two.
